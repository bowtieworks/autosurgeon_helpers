# Autosurgeon Helpers we needed at Bowtie

Â© 2023 Bowtie Works, Inc

These are our implementations of common autosurgeon implementations. They 
might help you. We might put a cargo file here so that we can import our 
own and not keep this library up as a weird copy and paste of our 
monorepo.
 
You should probably evaluate them to make sure they fit your needs.

or fixed my implementations.
